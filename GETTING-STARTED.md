# Getting Started

Welcome to your Contextium. Your AI already knows your name, your profession, and how you like to communicate. Here's what to do next.

## 1. Have a conversation

Open your AI agent in this directory and start talking. It already has your context.

Try:
- "Tell me about what I'm working on" — and then explain your current focus
- "Create a card for [person's name]" — start building your people directory
- "Start a project for [thing]" — kick off your first tracked initiative

Your AI creates the right files in the right places. You don't need to learn the structure first.

## 2. Come back tomorrow

Your AI remembers everything from today — decisions, context, what's next. That's the whole point. Every session builds on the last.

## 3. Close your sessions

When you're done working, just say **"close this out"** or **"wrap this up."** Your AI will:
- Write a journal entry summarizing what happened
- Maintain one Contextium commit for the day, with each session as a commit-body bullet
- Push to your backup (if you set up GitHub); amended same-day commits use `--force-with-lease`

This is how your AI's memory grows. Every session gets logged, every decision gets tracked.

## What Happens Automatically

- **Session start:** Your preferences and rules load automatically via hooks. Your AI behaves consistently from the first word.
- **Memory stays in the repo:** A hook prevents your AI from scattering notes in its own memory files. Everything lives here — version-controlled and searchable.

## What's Next (when you're ready)

| Want to... | Just ask your AI |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Connect a tool | "Set up Google Calendar" — it reads `templates/integrations/` and guides you |
| Add an automation | "I want a daily briefing email" — it scaffolds from `templates/apps/` |
| Track goals | "Set up goal tracking" — it builds the right structure |
| Learn the structure | "Explain how this repo is organized" — it walks you through |

Everything grows from conversation. You don't need to configure anything upfront.
