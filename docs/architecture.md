# Architecture

## Core Principle: Context as Infrastructure

Contextium treats your AI's context as infrastructure — not chat history, not embeddings, not a prompt library. A
structured, version-controlled repository that your AI reads and writes to.

## The Six Layers

### Layer 1: Instruction File

The AI's operating manual. The installer places **one** instruction file at the repo root based on which AI agent you
chose:

| Agent          | Root File                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `CLAUDE.md`                           |
| Codex CLI      | `AGENTS.md`                           |
| Gemini CLI     | `GEMINI.md`                           |
| Cursor         | `.cursorrules`                        |
| Windsurf       | `.windsurfrules`                      |
| Cline          | `.clinerules`                         |
| Aider          | `CONVENTIONS.md`                      |
| Continue       | `.continue/rules`                     |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`     |
| Ollama         | `Modelfile` + `CLAUDE.md` (reference) |

All contain the same core architecture — context router, session lifecycle, delegation rules — formatted for the
specific agent's instruction format. Ollama uses a Modelfile with the instructions baked into the SYSTEM prompt.
Templates for all agents live in `agent-configs/`.

The instruction file contains:
- **Context Router** — which files to load for which triggers (18 triggers including delegation pre-check, code conventions, incident response, people cards)
- **Session Classification** — New Project / Existing / One-Off
- **Repo Structure Map** — what each directory contains
- **Rule Index** — pointers to behavioral and governance rules

### Layer 2: Apps (`/apps/`)

Self-contained capabilities, each with:

- A protocol (README.md) defining how it works
- Optional automation scripts
- No data (data lives in `/knowledge/`)

**Boundary test:** Delete `knowledge/{domain}/` and the app still makes sense. Delete `apps/{name}/` and you have data
with no context.

**App Patterns:**

| Pattern       | Example           | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Reference     | Goals             | Manual protocol, no automation                    |
| Data Sync     | Health            | Webhook/timer syncs external data to repo         |
| Timer + Email | News Digest       | Cron fetches data, AI curates, sends email        |
| System/Event  | Error Remediation | Reacts to system events, auto-remediates          |
| Briefing      | Today's Agenda    | Daily scheduled aggregation from multiple sources |
| Utility       | Shared            | Reusable functions called by other apps           |

### Layer 3: Knowledge (`/knowledge/`)

Domain-organized reference data. Static and semi-static information:

- `growth/` — goals, reflections, coaching
- `health/` — biomarkers, supplements, genetics
- `finance/` — tax, insurance, assets
- `people/` — relationship cards for important people
- Custom domains you create during onboarding

### Layer 4: Integrations (`/integrations/`)

External service connectors. Each maintains:

- A README explaining setup and API usage
- Optional helper scripts
- Token management docs

### Layer 5: Preferences (`/preferences/`)

Rules, templates, and style guides:

- `user/preferences.md` — your communication and working style
- `rules/` — behavioral patterns (delegation, efficiency) + governance (credentials, hygiene)
- `templates/` — project, journal, app README formats
- `style_guides/` — email design, app development conventions

### Layer 6: Projects + Journal

**Projects** (`/projects/`): Time-boxed work in dated folders with README trackers.

**Journal** (`/journal/`): Daily structured logs (YAML, not prose) that capture decisions, lessons, and next steps.

## Key Design Patterns

### Lazy Loading

The context router loads files only when triggered — not everything at session start. This prevents token bloat and
keeps the AI focused.

### Delegation Architecture

Route expensive work to the right tool:

| Need                    | Route to            | Why                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Web research            | Gemini              | Summarizes externally, only result enters context |
| Bulk edits (>2 files)   | Codex               | Direct editing in separate context                |
| Scheduled tasks         | Automation platform | Deterministic, no AI cost                         |
| Local/private inference | Ollama              | Runs locally, no cost, works offline              |
| Quick facts             | Web search          | Cheapest, smallest result                         |

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Start** — Classify request (New Project / Existing / One-Off)
2. **Work** — Load context on demand, delegate when efficient
3. **End** — Journal entry + one daily Contextium commit + push

### Behavioral Enforcement

Rules aren't aspirational — they can be enforced:

- Git hooks prevent common mistakes
- Desired-state reconciliation catches drift
- Session governance ensures journal + push at session end

## Data Flow

```
You ←→ AI Agent ←→ CLAUDE.md (router)
                        ↓
           ┌────────────┼────────────┐
           ↓            ↓            ↓
        apps/      knowledge/   integrations/
           ↓            ↓            ↓
      projects/    journal/    preferences/
```

## No Vendor Lock-In

Everything is:

- Plain text markdown (human-readable)
- Version-controlled in git (full audit trail)
- YAML frontmatter (structured metadata)
- Portable (move to a different AI tomorrow)
