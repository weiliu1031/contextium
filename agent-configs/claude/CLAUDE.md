# AI Assistant Guide

## Session Start

Classify: **New Project** (multi-session -> project + tracker + journal) | **Existing** (prior work -> update + journal)
| **One-Off** (quick -> journal only). Default: journal-only.

## Context Router

Do NOT preload files — lazy load only when needed, **except** items marked "Every session" which MUST be loaded before doing any work. Re-evaluate triggers when task scope changes mid-session — if a new trigger matches, load it then.

| Trigger                                        | Load                                                                                                                              |

## First Session

If `journal/` contains no date files (only README.md), this is the user's first session.

- Greet them by name (from `preferences/user/preferences.md`)
- Acknowledge their profession and what they want AI to help with
- Invite conversation: "Tell me about what you're working on" or "Who are the key people I should know about?"
- Do NOT explain the repo structure, do NOT suggest setting up integrations
- Just talk. The context will build naturally.

## Session End — MANDATORY

Before your final response in every session, no matter how short:

1. Create/update `/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (load template if needed)
2. Commit specific files — never `git add -A`
3. Maintain one Contextium commit per local date:
   - Subject: `doc: update contextium journal`
   - Body: bullet list of that day's archived session items
   - First archive of the day creates the commit
   - Later archives on the same day amend that commit
   - Only amend if HEAD has today's author date and the exact subject above
4. Push:
   - New commit: `git push origin main`
   - Same-day amend: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`

No exceptions. A 2-minute discussion still gets a journal heading. See `preferences/rules/governance.md` § Session End for full format rules.

## New Apps — MANDATORY

After creating a new directory in `apps/`:

1. Create `apps/{name}/README.md` with frontmatter (name, description, category, schedule, runtime, trigger, outputs)
2. Add an entry to `apps/README.md` (alphabetical order)

An app without a README has no protocol. An app without a registry entry is invisible to future sessions.

## Automation Scripts

If you use an automation platform (Windmill, n8n, etc.) and edit a deployed script:

1. Deploy the updated script to the platform
2. Verify deployment succeeded

Editing without deploying has no effect — the platform runs its own copy. Skip if no automation platform is configured.
